When Triggers Can Be Invoked in SQL

Triggers in SQL are a set of actions that are automatically executed in response to certain events
or actions performed on a database table. These events can be insertions, updates, deletions,
or other modifications to the data. Here are all possible scenarios when triggers can be invoked in SQL:

1. Insert Operations

Before Insert: A trigger can be invoked before a new row is inserted into a table. This allows for validation, data transformation, or default value assignment.
After Insert: A trigger can be invoked after a new row has been inserted into a table. This allows for post-insert processing, such as updating related tables or sending notifications.
2. Update Operations

Before Update: A trigger can be invoked before an existing row is updated in a table. This allows for validation, data transformation, or default value assignment.
After Update: A trigger can be invoked after an existing row has been updated in a table. This allows for post-update processing, such as updating related tables or sending notifications.
3. Delete Operations

Before Delete: A trigger can be invoked before a row is deleted from a table. This allows for validation, data transformation, or default value assignment.
After Delete: A trigger can be invoked after a row has been deleted from a table. This allows for post-delete processing, such as updating related tables or sending notifications.
4. Other Operations

Instead Of: A trigger can be invoked instead of the original operation, allowing for custom processing or overriding the default behavior.
System Events: Some databases, like Oracle, allow triggers to be invoked on system events, such as startup, shutdown, or login.
5. Compound Triggers

Multiple Triggers: Multiple triggers can be defined for the same event, allowing for a sequence of actions to be performed.
Nested Triggers: Triggers can be nested, where one trigger invokes another trigger, allowing for complex processing flows.
6. Conditional Triggers

When Clause: Triggers can be defined with a WHEN clause, which specifies a condition that must be met for the trigger to be invoked.
IF Statement: Triggers can use IF statements to conditionally execute certain actions based on specific conditions.
These are all possible scenarios when triggers can be invoked in SQL. Do you have any specific questions or scenarios you'd like me to elaborate on?
